# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - Space X

## Introduction

In this capstone project, we will predict whether the Falcon 9’s first stage will land successfully and profitably. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly lower than other providers charging around $165 million. The cost savings largely stem from SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By determining the likelihood of a successful landing, we can estimate the value of a launch. This insight can be valuable for potential competitors looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.

This capstone project course offers hands-on experience, simulating real-world challenges that data scientists encounter when working with real datasets. You will take on the role of a Data Scientist at a startup aiming to rival SpaceX, applying the Data Science methodology throughout the process involving [data collection](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Data%20Collection%20API.ipynb), [data wrangling](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Data%20Wrangling.ipynb), [exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/EDA%20with%20SQL.ipynb), [data visualization](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb), [model development](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction.ipynb), [model evaluation](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction.ipynb), and [reporting](https://github.com/anaazizh/Data-Science-Capstone/blob/main/Ana-Data_Science-Capstone-Presentation.pdf) your results to stakeholders. Your task is to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land.

## Business Problem
SpaceX lists Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, whereas other providers charge upwards of $165 million, largely due to SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage. Accurately predicting the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing allows for better estimation of launch costs. Using your Data Science analysis and predictive models, the startup that hired you can make more competitive and informed bids against SpaceX for rocket launches.

## Objective
- Utilize the data science toolkit and machine learning to accurately predict the probability of a successful first-stage rocket landing, enabling a better estimation of launch costs.
- Analyze and explore the data to uncover valuable insights.

## Business Metric
Classification accuracy - number of correct prediction divided by the total number of prediction defined as:
$$Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$
